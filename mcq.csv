Day 1 Exam: The JPMC Ecosystem & Technical Strategy,You are analyzing a requirement for Inbound Transaction Monitoring (ITM). Why has this become a priority for UK Payment architectures in 2025?,Because the Bank of England now charges a fee for every inbound payment that is not screened.,Because new PSR rules mandate 50/50 liability split for APP Fraud; forcing banks to detect if their own customer is a mule receiving stolen funds.,Because ISO 20022 does not support outbound monitoring; shifting the burden to the receiving bank.,Because GDPR prevents banks from monitoring outbound payments due to data privacy concerns.,B
